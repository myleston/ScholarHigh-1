# How to run this app
in terminal on your mac
* cd path/to/directory/
* unzip ScholarHighPrototype1.xcodeproj.zip 
* pod install
* open ScholarHighPrototype1.xcworkspace

then, run(⌘r) and process files

# Attention
this is prototype, and sending messages part doesn't work well 

I'll fix this part by Sunday. Be patient.

I hope you propose good ideas about additional functions.
